## üìã Security Configuration Files

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
# JWT Secrets
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secure-refresh-secret

# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://user:pass@host:port/db

# Security
CSP_MODE=report-only
LOG_LEVEL=info
LOGGING_ENDPOINT=https://your-logging-service.com

```

### Security Headers Configuration
All security headers are configured in `src/middleware/security.ts` and can be customized in `src/config/security.ts`.

### Rate Limiting Configuration
Rate limits are configured in `src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts` and can be adjusted based on your application needs.

## üîç Security Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test authentication rate limiting
- [ ] Test input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Test XSS prevention
- [ ] Test CSRF protection
- [ ] Test file upload security
- [ ] Test session management
- [ ] Test error handling and information disclosure

### Automated Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for security functions
- [ ] Integration tests for authentication
- [ ] Security-focused API tests
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD

## üìû Incident Response

### Security Incident Response Plan
1. **Detection**: Monitor logs and alerts
2. **Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove threats
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures
